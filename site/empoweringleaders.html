        <p><span>When Peace Corps Volunteer Danielle Carrillo took a group of students to a girls&#39; leadership camp last year in her province in Cambodia, they came home with a challenge: to implement a project in their community.</span> Their idea? To address a local public health problem by building a bathroom for the local primary school, which didn&#39;t have one.
        </p>
        <p>The girls, who attended a Girls Leading Our World—GLOW—Camp got to work quickly. Danielle helped the girls write a grant proposal, using the Peace Corps Partnership Program, and the girls committed themselves to asking community members for contributions and to each lead two hand-washing and hygiene lessons for their fellow students.

        <p>Construction on the bathroom finished in the fall, and the girls have worked steadily to deliver their message of hand-washing and hygiene, using glitter to demonstrate how germs are spread and how to use soap to wash &ldquo;germs&rdquo; off.
        </p>
        <p>For her part, Danielle is organizing this year&#39;s Camp GLOW in her province, and plans to lead sessions on gender roles, life skills, and leadership.
        </p>
        <p>&ldquo;I think that Camp GLOW truly empowers the girls who attend,&rdquo; Danielle said. &ldquo;Since camp last year, I have seen real changes in their attitudes toward themselves and in their perspective of their futures. Their confidence has been boosted and they are so much more excited for the possibilities life has to offer … My community members and students are very excited to do it again this year.&rdquo;
        </p>
        <p>At the end of the camp, Danielle, her community members, and the girls will bring their new skills and knowledge back to the villages and empower even more young women. With increased gender training, Peace Corps Volunteers like Danielle will be able to make an even bigger, more sustainable difference in the lives of young women around the world.
