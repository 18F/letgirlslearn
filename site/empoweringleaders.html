          <span>After a year of working in her community in Nepal, one thing stood out strongly for Peace Corps Volunteer Alexandra Clayton.</span> Though there were many sports and youth clubs in the villages, they were all run by boys. There was no place for girls to come together, develop leadership and communications skills, and learn about current issues facing women in Nepal. So she did something about it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Alexandra and several other Volunteers decided to host a Camp GLOW&mdash;Girls Leading Our World&mdash;and invited 36 Nepali high-school girls to learn about health, gender roles, business, financial management, and life skills. In addition, each Volunteer brought a Nepali counterpart to help run the five-day camp, facilitating group activities and helping with translation. Though GLOW camps were started in 1995 by Peace Corps Volunteers in Romania, this was Nepal's first girls' empowerment camp. And, for many of the campers, it was a well-deserved break from their cooking and cleaning duties at home.

         <p>
          After the camp, the girls became leaders in their communities. They have spoken at schools, started their own girls' youth clubs, painted murals in their communities, and educated their communities on women's issues in Nepal. During those five days of camp, the Volunteers helped empower the girls to make changes in their communities that will last a lifetime.
        </p>
        <p>
          But they've only reached 36 of the 8.2 million young women in Nepal. Next year, Alexandra and her fellow Volunteers plan to host another Camp GLOW and bring back previous campers as counselors, as well as inspire other Peace Corps Volunteers in Nepal&mdash;and around the globe&mdash;to host more Camp GLOWs to reach more girls.
        </p>

        <p>
          With increased gender training, Peace Corps Volunteers like Alexandra will be able to make an even bigger, more sustainable difference in the lives of young women around the world.

        <p><span>When Peace Corps Volunteer Danielle Carrillo took a group of students to a girls&#39; leadership camp last year in her province in Cambodia, they came home with a challenge: to implement a project in their community.</span> Their idea? To address a local public health problem by building a bathroom for the local primary school, which didn&#39;t have one.
        </p>
        <p>The girls, who attended a Girls Leading Our World—GLOW—Camp got to work quickly. Danielle helped the girls write a grant proposal, using the Peace Corps Partnership Program, and the girls committed themselves to asking community members for contributions and to each lead two hand-washing and hygiene lessons for their fellow students.
        </p>
        <img class="full" src="img/pillar1_feature-c.jpg" alt="Girl with blue paint on hand.">
        <p>Construction on the bathroom finished in the fall, and the girls have worked steadily to deliver their message of hand-washing and hygiene, using glitter to demonstrate how germs are spread and how to use soap to wash &ldquo;germs&rdquo; off.
        </p>
        <p>For her part, Danielle is organizing this year&#39;s Camp GLOW in her province, and plans to lead sessions on gender roles, life skills, and leadership.
        </p>
        <p>&ldquo;I think that Camp GLOW truly empowers the girls who attend,&rdquo; Danielle said. &ldquo;Since camp last year, I have seen real changes in their attitudes toward themselves and in their perspective of their futures. Their confidence has been boosted and they are so much more excited for the possibilities life has to offer … My community members and students are very excited to do it again this year.&rdquo;
        </p>
        <p>At the end of the camp, Danielle, her community members, and the girls will bring their new skills and knowledge back to the villages and empower even more young women. With increased gender training, Peace Corps Volunteers like Danielle will be able to make an even bigger, more sustainable difference in the lives of young women around the world.
